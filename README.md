👋 Hi, I’m @OrangeCoding2021

I just recently graduated from my homeschooled highschool career with a 4.0+ GPA and a certificate in Python. 
I have grown up around computers all my life but have never gotten to deep into them.
I am trying to build up a programming portfolio. 
My experiences in programming inclued the aforementioned Python along with very little
experience with Java, Lua, HTML, and Powershell.


💞️ I’m looking to potentially collaborate on open source projects that can help me gain more coding experience
