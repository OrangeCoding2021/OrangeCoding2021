Hello there! I am OrangeCoding2021. I have been casually coding since around 2016. I am hoping to get more serious about programming as I continue my education towards a BS in CSC and Mathematics.

I graduated Highschool as a Homeschooler with a 4.0+ GPA in my highschool. I also gained a certificate in Python from a community college. 

Most of my coding experience has been in Python (2016- ). I have had some experience in Java (2019-) included a Data Structures course. I also have learned the basics of C++ and MIPS Assembly.

üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to potentially collaborate on open source projects that can help me gain more coding experience
