Hello there! I am OrangeCoding2021. I have been casually coding since around 2016. I am hoping to get more serious about programming as I continue my education towards a BS in CSC and Mathematics.

Most of my coding experience has been in Python (2016- ). I have had some experience in Java (2019-) included a Data Structures course. I also have learned the basics of C++ and MIPS Assembly.

💞️ I’m looking to potentially collaborate on open source projects that can help me gain more coding experience
