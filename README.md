👋 Hi, I’m @OrangeCoding2021

I graduated Highschooler as a Homeschooler with a 4.0+ GPA in highschool. I also gained a certificate in Python from a community college. 
I have grown up around computers all my life but have never gotten too deep into them.
I am now trying to build up my programming portfolio as I learn more about programming

Most of my coding experience has been in Python. I have had some experience in Java and am now currently in a Advanced Java course. I am also currently going to be learning C++ and Assembly Language.


💞️ I’m looking to potentially collaborate on open source projects that can help me gain more coding experience
