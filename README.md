Hello there! I am OrangeCoding2021. I have been casually coding since around 2016. I am hoping to get more serious about programming as I continue my education towards a BS in CSC.

I graduated Highschool as a Homeschooler with a 4.0+ GPA in my highschool. I also gained a certificate in Python from a community college. 
I have grown up around computers all my life but have never gotten too deep into them.
I am now trying to build up my programming portfolio as I learn more about programming

Most of my coding experience has been in Python (2016- ). I have had some experience in Java (2019-) and am now currently in a Advanced Java course. For college, I am in the process of learning C++ and MIPS assembly.

💞️ I’m looking to potentially collaborate on open source projects that can help me gain more coding experience
