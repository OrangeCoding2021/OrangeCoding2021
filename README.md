👋 Hi, I’m @OrangeCoding2021

I graduated Highschooler as a Homeschooler with a 4.0+ GPA. I also graduated with a certificate in Python from a community college. 
I have grown up around computers all my life but have never gotten too deep into them.
I am now trying to build up my programming portfolio as I learn more about programming
I have the most experience in Python followed by Java. I have also gained some experience in HTML, Lua, and Scratch.


💞️ I’m looking to potentially collaborate on open source projects that can help me gain more coding experience
